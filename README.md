Task 3 – Networking Basics for Cyber Security
NAME: DeepikaGL
Tools Used:
•	Wireshark
Objective:
To understand basic networking concepts and analyze live network traffic using packet sniffing tools.
________________________________________
Concepts Learned:
1.	TCP Handshake
o	TCP handshake is a 3-step process used to establish a connection between client and server.
o	Steps:
	SYN
	SYN-ACK
	ACK
o	This ensures reliable communication.
2.	Difference Between TCP and UDP
o	TCP is reliable and connection-oriented
o	UDP is faster but unreliable
o	TCP is used for web browsing and emails
o	UDP is used for streaming and gaming
3.	DNS (Domain Name System)
o	DNS converts domain names into IP addresses
o	Example: google.com → 142.250.x.x
o	Observed DNS queries in Wireshark
4.	Packet Sniffing
o	Packet sniffing means capturing and analyzing network packets
o	Wireshark is used to monitor network traffic
o	Helps in cybersecurity analysis and troubleshooting
5.	HTTP vs HTTPS
o	HTTP sends data in plain text
o	HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS
o	HTTPS is more secure than HTTP

Practical Work Done:
•	Installed Wireshark
•	Captured live network traffic
•	Applied filters:
o	TCP
o	DNS
o	HTTP
•	Observed TCP three-way handshake
•	Captured DNS queries
•	Identified difference between encrypted and unencrypted traffic

Files Included in Repository:
•	Packet capture file (.pcap)
•	Screenshots of Wireshark analysis
•	README.md report

Outcome:
This task helped me gain practical knowledge of:
•	How network traffic works
•	How packets flow between client and server
•	How attackers can analyze insecure traffic
•	Basics of network monitoring using Wireshark
